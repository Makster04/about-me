      <p>Hi, my name is Mak Trnka and I graduated from UW in 2022 with a BA in Poli Sci and 
        International Studies. When it comes to job expirience, I was a Behavior Technican for 
        about a year where I gained a lot of expirience when it comes to social work and data. 
        However, I now changed my career into wanting to work for tech as either a web developer or data scientist. 
        Therefore, I set my goal to take courses before hand to apply myself and gain skills in coding!</p>
